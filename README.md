Video about the project here: https://youtu.be/eWm-MJ5vayw
 
This project uses an ATTiny85 as its MCU
 
You'll need to add this package to the Arduino IDE to build it:  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sleemanj/optiboot/master/dists/package_gogo_diy_attiny_index.json
 
Sound effect 3 is missing because of copyright reasons. They need copying to the SD card in numerical orderfor this to work correctly.
